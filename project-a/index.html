                The Noctiflor (Moonless Wing) lifecycle is tied to the lunar phases. The flower blooms during the full
                moon, but dies during the new moon. Some say that upon its death, a flurry of butterflies emerges.
                However, there is nothing good about the sighting of a Noctiflor. In magic folklore, Noctiflorâ€™s
                presence symbolizes a disturbance in the fabric of time and memory. These encounters typically happen
                during the witching hours. When the veil between the worlds grows thin, dark entities tend to slip
                beyond the boundaries. Some believe that witnessing a Noctiflor is to invite shadows from forgotten
                timelines or glimpse into strange memories. Some have even gone mad after. As a result, Noctiflor is an
                omen as beautiful as it is unsettling.
