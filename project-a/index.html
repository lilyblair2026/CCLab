                    The Noctiflor (Moonless Wing) lifecycle is tied to the lunar phases. The flower blooms during the
                    full
                    moon, but dies during the new moon. Some say that upon its death, a flurry of butterflies emerges.
                    However, there is nothing good about the sighting of a Noctiflor. In magic folklore, Noctiflorâ€™s
                    presence symbolizes a disturbance in the fabric of time and memory. These encounters typically
                    happen
                    during the witching hours. When the veil between the worlds grows thin, dark entities tend to slip
                    beyond the boundaries. Some believe that witnessing a Noctiflor is to invite shadows from forgotten
                    timelines or glimpse into strange memories. Some have even gone mad after. As a result, Noctiflor is
                    an
                    omen as beautiful as it is unsettling.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with the creature: </span>
                The Noctiflor is best
                observed under a full moon. However, you must leave the area before the Noctiflor begins to die. Those
                present may be transported into a lost timeline or completely lose their memory.
